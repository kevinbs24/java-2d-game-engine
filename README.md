## Java 2D Game Engine

This repository documents the step-by-step evolution of a simple Java 2D game
engine built using Swing. The project starts with a Snake implementation to
establish core systems, then expands into Breakout and a Zelda-style adventure
game.

### Goals
- Learn professional game architecture
- Build reusable systems
- Demonstrate incremental development

### Versions
- v0.1: Core engine (loop, input, collision)
- v0.2: Snake (complete)
- v0.3: Breakout
- v1.0: Zelda-style game
